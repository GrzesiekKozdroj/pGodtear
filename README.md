### General info
This is a dummy repository to explain what I made within over 10 000 ines of code, I decided to keep source repository private for some reason, maybe because it includes my node server files. In this game there are 4 main types of champions, you need to select 3 champions, your nickname and name of 'place' where the battle will happen, you also need opponent who will join this game as well, she/he will need to choose his own 3 heroes, different nickname and has to type in exact same 'place' to join you in battle, once thats done, each of you need to deploy one whole team, piece by piece, once all teams are deployed so callet 'plot phase' takes place, where each opponent moves ALL of his troops, once =thats done a clash phase begins where each player activates only one team at once.</br>
Each team has its own unique champion and unique followers that have their own unique sets of abilities for both clash and plot phase, objective of the game is to get 5 points, points are allocated and the end of clash phase depending on turn number and location of golden token on the 'ladder' at the bottom of the screen.
